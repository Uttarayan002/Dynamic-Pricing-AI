# Dynamic Pricing Engine for Niche E-commerce Using Reinforcement Learning (In-Progress)
## Executive Summary
**What’s the problem?**
E‑commerce platforms often use static, one‑size‑fits‑all discount rules (For instance, 10% off every item after 30 days). This approach fails to adapt to changing demand, inventory levels, product life‑cycles, and competitor pricing—leading to lost sales opportunities, margin erosion, and stock‑out or overstock risks.

**Why are we solving it?**
The revenue and profitability hinge on getting price right every time. A smarter, data‑driven pricing engine can:
Boost margins by avoiding unnecessary deep discounts
Improve conversions by offering the right deal at the right moment
Optimize inventory by accelerating slow movers or protecting scarce stock
Stay competitive by reacting to market and competitor moves in near real‑time

**So what?**
Implementing this solution translates to measurable business impact:
10–20% bump in profit per view through targeted discounting
Reduced stock‑out rates (<5%) by dynamically adjusting prices based on inventory health
15–25% cut in margin leakage by replacing blunt promotional slabs with learned, product‑specific pricing
And, importantly, a demonstrable AI‑powered system that can spin‑off into other decision‑making areas (marketing, inventory forecasting), showcasing a real‑world, ROI‑driven data‑science capability.
